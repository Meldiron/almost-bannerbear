Help us keep Utopia-php open and inclusive. Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Meldiron/og-image-generator/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Submit a Pull Request üöÄ

Branch naming convention is as following

```
TYPE-ISSUE_ID-DESCRIPTION
```

example:

```
doc-548-submit-a-pull-request-section-to-contribution-guide
```

When `TYPE` can be:

- **feat** - is a new feature
- **doc** - documentation only changes
- **cicd** - changes related to CI/CD system
- **fix** - a bug fix
- **refactor** - code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature

**All PRs must include a commit message with the changes description!**

For the initial start, fork the project and use git clone command to download the repository to your computer. A standard procedure for working on an issue would be to:

1. `git pull`, before creating a new branch, pull the changes from upstream. Your master needs to be up to date.

```
$ git pull
```

2. Create new branch from `master` like: `doc-548-submit-a-pull-request-section-to-contribution-guide`

```
$ git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch]
```

3. Work - commit - repeat ( be sure to be in your branch )

4. Push changes to GitHub

```
$ git push origin [name_of_your_new_branch]
```

6. Submit your changes for review If you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a `Compare & pull request` button. Click on that button.

7. Start a Pull Request Now submit the pull request and click on `Create pull request`.

8. Get a code review approval/reject

9. After approval, merge your PR

10. GitHub will automatically delete the branch after the merge is done. (they can still be restored).

## Introducing New Features

We would üíñ you to contribute to OG Image Generator, but we would also like to make sure this repository is as great as possible and loyal to its vision and mission statement üôè.

For us to find the right balance, please open an issue explaining your ideas before introducing a new pull request.

This will allow the our community to have sufficient discussion about the new feature value and how it fits in the product roadmap and vision.

This is also important for the lead developers to be able to give technical input and different emphasis regarding the feature design and architecture.

## Adding A New Adapter
